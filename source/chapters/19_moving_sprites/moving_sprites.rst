
Moving Sprites 移动精力
==============

How do we get sprites to move?怎样才能使精灵动起来？

To customize our sprite's behavior, we need to subclass the ``Sprite`` class with our own child class. This is easy:
想要定义精灵的行为，我们只需要创建 Sprite 的子类，这很容易做到：

.. code-block:: Python

    class Coin(arcade.Sprite):

We need to provide each sprite with a ``update`` method. The ``update`` method is automatically called to update the sprite's position.
我们需要为精灵提供一个 update 方法，update 方法会自动被调用，更新精灵的位置。

.. code-block:: Python

    class Coin(arcade.Sprite):

        def update(self):
            # Code to move goes here

Wait! We have a new class called Coin, but we aren't using it. Find in our
original code this line:
我们有个一名为 Coin 的新类，但我们没有使用。找到我们的原代码行：

.. code-block:: Python

    coin = arcade.Sprite("coin_01.png", COIN_SPRITE_SCALING)

See how it is creating an instance of ``Sprite``? We want to create an instance
of our new ``Coin`` class instead:

.. code-block:: Python

    coin = Coin("coin_01.png", COIN_SPRITE_SCALING)

Now, how do we get the coin to move?

Moving Sprites Down
-------------------

To get the sprites to "fall" down the screen, we need to make their y location
smaller. This is easy. Over-ride ``update`` in the sprite and subtract from
y each frame:

.. code-block:: Python

    class Coin(arcade.Sprite):

        def update(self):
            self.center_y -= 1

Next, create an instance of the ``Coin`` class instead of a ``Sprite`` class.

    :caption: Sprite Sample Move Down
    :language: python
    :emphasize-lines: 15-18, 64
    :linenos:

This causes the coins to move down. But once they move off the screen they
keep going into negative-coordinate land. We can't see them any more. Sad.

Resetting to the Top
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can get around this by resetting the coins up to the top. Here's how its
done:

.. code-block:: Python

    class Coin(arcade.Sprite):

        def update(self):
            self.center_y -= 1

            # See if we went off-screen
            if self.center_y < 0:
                self.center_y = SCREEN_HEIGHT

But this isn't perfect. Because if your eyes are fast, you can see the coin
'pop' in and out of existence at the edge. It doesn't smoothly slide off. This is
because we move it when the *center* of the coin is at the edge. Not the top of
the coin has slid off.

There are a couple ways we can do this. Here's one. We'll check at -20 instead
of 0. As long as the coin radius is 20 or less, we are good.

.. code-block:: Python

    class Coin(arcade.Sprite):

        def update(self):
            self.center_y -= 1

            # See if we went off-screen
            if self.center_y < -20:
                self.center_y = SCREEN_HEIGHT + 20

There's another way. In addition to ``center_y``, sprites have other
members that are useful in these cases. They are ``top``, ``bottom``,
``left`` and ``right``. So we can do this:

.. code-block:: Python

    class Coin(arcade.Sprite):

        def update(self):
            self.center_y -= 1

            # See if we went off-screen
            if self.top < 0:
                self.bottom = SCREEN_HEIGHT

Doing this allows the coins to smoothly slide on and off the screen. But since
they reappear at the top, we get repeating patters. See the image below:

.. figure:: pattern.gif

    Coins repeating in a pattern

Instead we can randomize it a bit:

.. code-block:: Python

    def update(self):

        # Move the coin
        self.center_y -= 1

        # See if the coin has fallen off the bottom of the screen.
        # If so, reset it.
        if self.top < 0:
            # Reset the coin to a random spot above the screen
            self.center_y = random.randrange(SCREEN_HEIGHT + 20,
                                             SCREEN_HEIGHT + 100)
            self.center_x = random.randrange(SCREEN_WIDTH)

Never Ending Coins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This works, but when we we collect all the coins we are done. What if it was
a never-ending set of coins? Instead of "killing" the coin, let's reset it to
the top of the screen.

.. code-block:: Python

    def update(self, delta_time):
        """ Movement and game logic """

        self.coin_list.update()

        hit_list = arcade.check_for_collision_with_list(self.player_sprite, self.coin_list)

        for coin in hit_list:
            self.score += 1

            # Reset the coin to a random spot above the screen
            coin.center_y = random.randrange(SCREEN_HEIGHT + 20,
                                             SCREEN_HEIGHT + 100)
            coin.center_x = random.randrange(SCREEN_WIDTH)

We can even take that common code, and move it to a method. Here's a full example:

.. literalinclude:: sprite_sample_move_down_full.py

Bouncing Coins
--------------

Instead of always adding one to the y-coordinate and have the sprites move
down, we can keep a vector by using ``change_x`` and ``change_y``. By
using these, we can have the sprite bounce around the screen:

.. figure:: sprites_bouncing.gif

TODO: Put in some text about spawning a sprite too close to the edge. Also make a refer to it from the final
project.


Take what you've learned from the example above, and see if you can replicate
this:

Rotating Sprites
----------------

Sprites can easily be rotated by setting their ``angle`` attribute. Angles are
in degrees. So the following will flip the player upside down:

.. code-block:: Python

    self.player_sprite.angle = 180

If you put this in the coin's ``update`` method, it would cause the coins to
spin:

.. code-block:: Python

    self.angle += 1

    # If we rotate past 360, reset it back a turn.
    if self.angle > 359:
        self.angle -= 360
